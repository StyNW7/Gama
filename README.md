## 🇮🇩 About The Project

**Gama** is a location-based mobile adventure game that transforms real-world exploration into a captivating journey through Indonesian culture. Inspired by the thrill of discovery in games like Pokémon GO, our mission is to gamify cultural education and preservation.

Players explore real-world landmarks to find recipes and resources, craft historical artifacts, and build a personal digital museum—the **Buku Pusaka**. It's more than a game; it's an interactive celebration of the rich tapestry of Indonesian heritage.

## ✨ Core Features

* 🗺️ **Real-World Exploration**: Visit "Pusaka Points"—actual historical sites, museums, and cultural landmarks across Indonesia.
* 📜 **Recipe Collection**: Discover and collect recipes for traditional artifacts unique to each region you visit.
* 💎 **Resource Gathering**: Find randomly spawning "Resource Chests" to gather materials like wood, textiles, metals, and natural dyes.
* 🛠️ **Strategic Crafting**: Use your collected recipes and resources to craft cultural items, from weaponry like the *Golok* to intricate *Batik* textiles.
* 📖 **The Buku Pusaka**: Your personal digital collection book (like a Pokédex) that stores your crafted items, detailing their history, origin, and cultural significance.
* 👤 **Public Profiles**: Showcase your beautifully crafted collection to friends and other players.
* 🤝 **Community-Driven Content**: Players can propose new cultural items and "Pusaka Points" to be added to the game, ensuring it grows with the community's passion and knowledge.

## 🎮 The Gameplay Loop

The core experience of Gama is built on a simple yet engaging four-step cycle:

1.  **EXPLORE**: Travel to real-world **Pusaka Points** to check in and unlock unique cultural content.
2.  **COLLECT**: Receive a **Recipe** for a local artifact upon visiting a landmark. Gather crafting **materials** from Resource Chests that appear in the world around you.
3.  **CRAFT**: Combine your recipes and materials in the crafting menu to create a digital replica of a cultural artifact.
4.  **LEARN & DISPLAY**: Your new creation is added to your **Buku Pusaka**, unlocking a rich entry about its history. Display it proudly on your public profile!
